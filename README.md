## The Games

### Recipe Rhythm
A recipe flashes. Then it's gone. Ingredients float like bubbles — tap them in the right order before the memory fades. Can you hold the recipe in your head?

### Spice Bubbles
No smell, no color — just words. Pop the right spice and a scent memory appears. Over six levels, black and white becomes beautiful chaos, and your brain starts to remember how things smell.
